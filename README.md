A WIP... thing for learning javascript app development with node. My goal is to implement a swiss board game called [Br√§ndi Dog](https://www.braendi-dog.de) as a multiplayer game. 

For the backend I'm using express.js and peerjs. For the frontend, I'm excited to give [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) a try.
