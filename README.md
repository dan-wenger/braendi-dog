A wip/fun project for learning javascript app development with node. My goal is to implement a swiss board game called [Br√§ndi Dog](https://www.braendi-dog.de) and make it work over WebRTC. I want as much as possible to be done client-side. 

The express backend with implemented [peerjs-server](https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server) is responsible for serving the static files and for doing the signaling. For the frontend I'm excited to give [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) a try! Going good so far
